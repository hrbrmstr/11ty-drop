<h1>Bonus Drop #89 (2023-04-02): There. Are. Four. Hundos.</h1>
<p>Eleventy; Penthouse/Critical CSS;</p>
<p>There's no foolin' the next-level supporters of the Drop! Meaning: I deliberately avoided posting the Bonus Drop yesterday, lest have ye wondering if any given topic was duplicitous or faithful.</p>
<p>Portions of non-Drop activities have leaked their way into these newsletters, including today's.</p>
<p>As I was creating my most recent <a href="https://rud.is/w/webr-lit-plot/">web-centric WebR experiment</a>—FOOT— I learned a new term: &quot;Four Hundos&quot;. This is in the context of <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-rud-is-w-webr-lit-plot/4zg2reow30?form_factor=desktop">Google Lighthouse scores</a>:</p>
<p><img src="img/four-hundos.png-inv.png" alt="four-hundos">
(these would be green if I had not lazily inverted them to avoid blinding dark-mode folks)</p>
<p>where folks in front-end land seem to acquire bragging rights <em>(rightfully so!)</em> for achieving a &quot;perfect four&quot; on both desktop and mobile browsers.</p>
<p>So, today, we'll explore a (relatively) new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site generator</a> that is both creator- and &quot;hundos&quot;-friendly and a tool/site to help you up-level your CSS (since, we are all kind of web publishers, now).</p>
<h3>Eleventy</h3>
<p>If you've been bouncing around the internets of late, you have most certainly come across at least one site that uses Eleventy (<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty.dev</a>).</p>
<p>Out of the gate, it decides to show off, both by proclaiming how &quot;easy&quot; it is and then how fast it is:</p>
<p><img src="img/2023-04-02-14-21-39.png" alt="benchmarks"></p>
<p>11ty also shows its javascript roots right up front, <em>and that's OK</em>! Don't dismiss it just because you may need to work in <code>npm</code>-land. Read on, to see why, especially if you like making fast, secure, and easily maintainable websites using data and templates with almost zero hassle.</p>
<p>I can still hear you muttering: &quot;I already use Markdown and $NAME site generator.&quot; What's it like living with such a restriction? Eleventy supports a wide range of templating languages such as HTML <em>(duh)</em>, Markdown <em>(ofc)</em>, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>, <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, <a href="https://ejs.co/">EJS</a>, <a href="https://haml.info/">Haml</a>, and many others. You may discover you work better in another (or, <em>many</em>!) one; or, if you publish a team, other members can work in what fits their style.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons folks gravitate towards Eleventy is its ease of use. Here are three additional aspects (besides the aforementioned &quot;template&quot; thing) that contribute to its simplicity:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Zero Configuration</em>: 11ty works out of the box without any configuration, making it incredibly easy to get started. You can create a new project and start building your site with minimal setup.</li>
<li><em>Extensive Documentation</em>: 11ty has seriously comprehensive documentation covers everything from installation to advanced customization. You can start using 11ty regardless of your current skill level.</li>
<li><em>Batteries Included/Available</em>: 11ty ships with an incredible about of functionality, but it has a rich ecosystem and very active community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites built with Eleventy are &quot;static&quot;, just like other ones (e.g. Hugo, Quarto, Jekyll), so this is a big reason for their speed claim. They also perform incremental content builds <em>(a feature also in other generators, like Quarto)</em> meaning that only the files that have changed will be rebuilt. This feature significantly reduces build times, especially for large projects. Unlike many things in javascript-land, 11ty has minimal dependencies, which further help speed up builds.</p>
<p>Seeing is believing. Perhaps I'll coax you into trying it out by taking the source for this Bonus Edition (I start all Drops in markdown) and put it into a slightly more-than-bare-bones 11ty site.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir 11ty-drop
cd 11ty-drop

# you need npm

# start a new project
npm init -y

# install 11ty
npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev

# copy files/dirs i use to craft the Drops

# build the site
npx @11ty/eleventy

# serve it (which will perform incremental builds)
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve

# create a `.eleventy.js` config file
touch .eleventy.js

# i put addditions step-by-step in there

# create a &quot;template&quot; for our &quot;site&quot;
mkdir _includes
touch core.njk

# add the simple nunjuks template you see in the GH repo I made for this

# add the basic CSS I mis-use everywhere (it's in the repo)

# one more time
npx @11ty/eleventy
</code></pre>

<h3>FIN</h3>
<p>Just two extra topics since I spent far too much time, this weekend, on a <a href="https://github.com/hrbrmstr/macoswasmr">non-web WebR project</a> that I think a few folks will find useful.</p>
<p>Thank ye once more for your support! ☮</p>
